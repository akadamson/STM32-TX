# STM32-TX - Integration of STM32 and a couple of Radio chipsets

#### NOTICE: Non-functional at the moment, work in process ####

20130821 - beginning schematic capture - ADF7012 is pretty much complete on the radio side 
         - Note this is a VHF implementation at the moment with the final filter components, etc.

20131201 - added SIradio directory with v0.1 4464 radio.  Notes: is 3v3 only but could work on a pro-mini if 3v3 version.  Laid our for STM32-MiniF3 as a daughter card mate (sandwich).  This version is 144mhz version

20131204 - updates SIradio with v0.2 4464 radio version… Nothing significant, just fixed some trace widths, some routing and added some silkscreen to the bottom of the board… Still working on final version ready for a board build.
